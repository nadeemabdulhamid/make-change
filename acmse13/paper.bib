  BOOKTITLE = {Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics:

  YEAR = 1999,
  ABSTRACT = {We present the formal proofs of total correctness of three sorting
  algorithms in the system Coq, namely \textit{insertion sort},
  \textit{quicksort} and \textit{heapsort}. The implementations are
  imperative programs working in-place on a given array. Those
  developments demonstrate the usefulness of inductive types and higher-order
  logic in the process of software certification. They also
  show that the proof of rather complex algorithms may be done in a
  small amount of time --- only a few days for each development ---
  and without great difficulty.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a new approach to certifying imperative programs,
  in the context of Type Theory.
  The key is a functional translation of imperative programs, which is
  made possible by an analysis of their effects.
  On sequential imperative programs, we get the same proof
  obligations as those given by Floyd-Hoare logic,
  but our approach also includes functional constructions.
  As a side-effect, we propose a way to eradicate the use of auxiliary
  variables in specifications.
  This work has been implemented in the Coq Proof Assistant and applied
  on non-trivial examples.},
