The \emph{change making problem} poses the task of determining how to represent a given value using the fewest coins from a given set of denominations. Change making is a variation of the general knapsack problem in which the number of items (coins) available is usually considered unbounded and the goal is to minimize the total number of items selected to fit in the knapsack (represented by the target value).
